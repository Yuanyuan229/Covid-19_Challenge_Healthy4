# Covid-19_Challenge_Healthy4
### 1) Project Summary: <br>
This project uses Covid-19 data to discuss the impact of government reaction on the matter of disease control of New York State. The project first compares the government responses of Wuhan, China and NY state after each area discovered its regional first case. Then, within the U.S., the project will further look at the responses of different parties including WHO, CDC and NY State government. The word cloud will shed a light on the change of politicians' attitudes towards the disease. Users of our html can also vision what the situation will be like if the current disease control measure takes place in another time.

<b>Time Series Model Forecast Vis.ipynb: </b> This code builds the visualization of time series model. <br>
<b>COVID-19-SEIR.ipynb: </b> This code builds the SEIR simulation model to simulate the pandemic for New York State.

### 4) Bonus Dataset:
